<br><br>
<b>So the point is, we are very keen to listen your proposal :slightly_smiling_face:</b>

## Tell us about your plan !
  <p>
    As you know in this week you have to create your own projects. 
    But before that tell us about your idea in brief, so that we can guide you. 
    <br> The questions you need to answer are:
    <ul>
      <li> What are you making? </li>
      <li> Components you are using? </li>
      <li> What's your expected output? </li>
      <li> Any special guidance from us? </li>
      <li> Other things that you wanna tell us. </li>
  </ul>

    <b>Prepare a proper document in which you need to answer above questions and submit it to us on link redirected by robot above.</b>
    <br>
    You can add references or images to showcase the idea of your project and if you started working on it do tell us about your progress.
  <br>

## Go ahead with your project
Create whatever you want and feel free to contact us if you face any difficulty.<br>
There is no submission link for this week. You may need to present it to all seniors and your batchmates in an official robotics meet :grinning:.
